<!-- Test for securing that mutation will not breake model consistency 
node "test" depends on elem3 because "test"s mutation -add node="elem3"- refers to elem3 as an object,
and also mutation -node id= "elem3" depends on elem3 as creation mutation.
Please note elem3 is not attached to elem1
If client tries to mutate elem1 by any mutation, it will breake  the system consistency
Client (Studio) must handle this request from the user correctly: get dependency and
apply the mutation to the node with rank not less that dep rank. In our case it
can mutate node "test"
How to test:  From Studio try to add to elem3 some node 
Expected result: Studio will place mutation not in elem1 as attaching owner, but
to -test- after dependent mutation. Try to save and reopen the mutated system - 
no error can occur.
