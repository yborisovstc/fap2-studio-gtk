<!-- Test for securing that mutation will not breake model consistency 
node "test" depends on elem2 because "test"s mutation -node id="elem3"- refers to elem2 as a parent.
So client tries to mutate elem1 by removing elem2 but there is dep on elem2 from test- breakage 
Client (Studio) must handle this request from the user correctly: get dependency and
apply the mutation to the node with rank not less that dep rank. In our case it
can mutate node "test"
Next test is to remove elem1 - it also elem3 as dependent node via elem1 component elem2
Remove elem1 and verify the system remains consistent
